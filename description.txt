Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories to make the game cooler and more fun.

It is recommended to use this mod alongside the Wing Slot mod, since it is something I wanted to implement in this mod, but people have already done it very well and I'm lazy.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know on the mod's Github.

[c/8ffdff:Features + Changes]
- [i:939] Web Slinger acts like Spiderman's web slingers and can drop from Wall Creepers and Black Recluses // TODO smoother movment and stop plater's velocity from changing while staying still
- [i:84][i:4978] Hooks and wings display their stats in their tooltips
- [i:193] Any recipe requiring an item that can be upgraded with an Obsidian Skull can also have the Obsidian Skull upgraded version used in the recipe instead of the original, though this does not give the resulting item the effects of the Obsidian Skull e.g recipes that require the [i:1322] Magma Stone can also use the [i:3999] Magma Skull and [i:4003] Molten Skull Rose as an alternative
- [i:5000] Terraspark boots have a slightly different crafting tree and have been buffed // TODO lava waders recipe isnt getting removed
- [i:1613] Ankh shield has a slightly different crafting tree and has been buffed // TODO: give 2 new ankh items textures + names
- [i:1164] Bundle of ballons has a slightly different crafting tree and has been buffed // TODO texture + recipe isnt getting removed

[c/8ffdff:Ideas and Planned Features + Changes]
- Config - probably coming next update
- Cross mod tooltips for wings and hooks - probably coming next update as well
- Flight boots can be used with wings after all flight time has been used up - May not happen since it probably won't be used
- Magic carpet is considered a wing accessory and acts more like celestial starboard - If it happens it will be after config so people that prefer normal magic carpet can still have it + its kinda pointless since magic carpet isnt in every world
- Extra jump items and rocket boots and its upgrades display stats in their tooltips - May not happen since its kinda pointless
- Architect gizmo pack gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
- Grand design gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed - May not happen since it could be really difficult
- Illuminant dye, which fully illuminates a player when equipped in dye slots (useful for keeping track of the player in dark spaces, probably will be obtained by the dye trader while in a graveyard)
- An accessory that increases defense as your health decreases
- An accessory that is a combination of the Treasure Magnet and Greedy Ring (maybe celestial magnet as well)?
- Cell phone gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed - probably include demon conch and magic conch and allow you to teleport to oceans and hell
