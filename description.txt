Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories to make the game better (at least I think its better).
It is recommended to use this mod alongside the Wing Slot mod, since it basically gives you an extra accessory slot, which gives this mod more purpose.
If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please make them on the homepage.
If you would like to help out with the mod development, DM me on Discord ().
