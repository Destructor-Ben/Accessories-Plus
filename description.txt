Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories to make the game cooler and more fun.

It is recommended to use this mod alongside the Wing Slot mod, since it is something I wanted to implement in this mod, but people have already done it very well and I'm lazy.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know on the mod's Github.

Also I couldn't be bothered to finish the new Ankh Shield items names and texture or finish the web slinger and I really wanted to release the mod, so those are going to change soon.

[c/8ffdff:Features + Changes]
- [i:939] Web Slinger acts like Spiderman's web slingers and can drop from Wall Creepers and Black Recluses
- [i:84][i:4978] Hooks and wings display their stats in their tooltips
- [i:193] Any recipe requiring an item that can be upgraded with an Obsidian Skull can also have the Obsidian Skull upgraded version used in the recipe instead of the original, though this does not give the resulting item the effects of the Obsidian Skull e.g recipes that require the [i:1322] Magma Stone can also use the [i:3999] Magma Skull and [i:4003] Molten Skull Rose as an alternative
- [i:5000] Terraspark Boots have a slightly different crafting tree and have been buffed
