Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories to make the game a bit easier, more fun, and cooler.

It is recommended to use this mod alongside the Wing Slot mod, since it is something I wanted to implement in this mod, but people have already done it well

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please make or report them on the mod's Github.
