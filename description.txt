Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories to make the game better.

There is an option to use each feature in the config, so if you don't like one of them you can disable it.

It is recommended to use this mod alongside the Wing Slot mod, since it is something I wanted to implement in this mod, but people have already done it very well and I'm lazy.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know on the mod's Github.
