Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories, equipment, and accessory slots to improve and balance Terraria.

There is an option to use each feature in the config, so if you don't like some of them you can disable them. The config also lists the features in more detail.

The mod is not complete yet, and many more features such as improvements and reworks to mounts, minecarts, grappling hooks, pets, and more accessories will be coming.

If you find any bugs, have any suggestions, or want compatiblity with large content mods such as Calamity, please let me know on the mod's Steam Page, [url=https://github.com/Destructor-Ben/Accessories-Plus]Github Repository[/url] or [url=https://discord.gg/uQzTRx2V8Y]Discord Server[/url]

The changelog can be found on the Steam Workshop page under the change notes.
