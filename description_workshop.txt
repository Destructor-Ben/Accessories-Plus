Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories, equipment, and accessory slots to improve and balance Terraria.

There is an option to use each feature in the config, so if you don't like some of them you can disable them.

If you find any bugs, have any suggestions, or want compatiblity with large content mods such as Calamity, please let me know on the mod's Steam or Github page.

The changelog can be found on the Steam Workshop page under the change notes.

To find the recipes changes, use the Recipe Browser mod.
