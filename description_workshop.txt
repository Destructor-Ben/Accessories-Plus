Accessories+ adds and tweaks accessories to make the game better.

There is an option to use each feature in the config, so if you don't like one of them you can disable it.

Support for Calamity is coming soon.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know on the mod's Steam or Github page.
