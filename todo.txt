 There isn't one


Ideas:
 Architect gizmo pack gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
 Grand design gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
 Cell phone gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed - probably include demon conch and magic conch and allow you to teleport to oceans and hell

 An accessory that increases defense as your health decreases
 An accessory like mana flower, but for health - include charm of myths
 An accessory that is a combination of the Treasure Magnet and Greedy Ring (maybe celestial magnet as well)?
 An accessory that is a combination of all arena buffs but doesn't have to be equipped
 Combination of mana cloak celestial magnet and mana regen band
 More infinite ammo

 Make rare accessories more common for less grinding to give the mod more purpose
 Make rod of discord more common - drop from queen slime instead of chaos elementals?
 Tidy up mana flower tree and regen band trees

 Increased drop rate of all accessories so less grinding
