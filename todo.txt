This updates plans:
 An accessory that increases defense as your health decreases
 An accessory like mana flower, but for health
 An accessory that is a combination of the Treasure Magnet and Greedy Ring (maybe celestial magnet as well)?
 Cell phone gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed - probably include demon conch and magic conch and allow you to teleport to oceans and hell
 Web slinger even more

Next updates plan:
 Illuminant dye, which fully illuminates a player when equipped in dye slots (useful for keeping track of the player in dark spaces, probably will be obtained by the dye trader while in a graveyard or at night)
 Cross mod tooltips for wings, hooks, extra jumps, and rocket boots
 Extra jump items and rocket boots and its upgrades display stats in their tooltips
 Magic carpet is considered a wing accessory and acts more like celestial starboard - this will have a config toggle for people who prefer it the vanilla way


Ideas:
 Architect gizmo pack gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
 Grand design gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
