Long Term Plans:
 Make a tree of every accessory to make a bunch of mega combo accessories
 Make accessories more accessible - May change fishing and angler quests a bit + traveling merchant spawns and prices
 Make prefixes better - get previous one so you don't have to keep reforging & make reforging easier
 Better Web Slinger + Drill
 Compatibility with Calamity



Ideas:
 Architect gizmo pack gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
 Grand design gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed
 Cell phone gets a different crafting tree and gets buffed - probably include demon conch and magic conch and allow you to teleport to oceans and hell

 An accessory that increases defense as your health decreases
 An accessory like mana flower, but for health - include charm of myths
 An accessory that is a combination of the Treasure Magnet and Greedy Ring (maybe celestial magnet as well)?
 An accessory that is a combination of all arena buffs but doesn't have to be equipped
 Combination of mana cloak celestial magnet and mana regen band
 Combination of all bee accessories

 Tidy up mana flower tree and regen band 
 Recipes for aglet, climbing claws, show spikes, hermes boots, lucky horseshoe, shiny red balloon, lava charm, the emblems, and ice skates

 Increased drop rate of all accessories so less grinding

 When items are combined and at least one item has a prefix, the prefix will be given to the crafted item - if there are two the player will be asked which one they want
